Hey there! Web accessibility is super important for creating websites that can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. Here are some tips to help you master it:

    1. Alt tags: Use 'em! Alt tags describe images for people who can't see them. Keep them short, sweet, and informative.

    2. Headings are your friend: Use them to organize content and help screen readers navigate through your site. Make sure they accurately reflect the content.

    3. Don't forget about videos: Provide captions or transcripts for your videos so everyone can enjoy them, even if they're deaf or hard of hearing.

There you have it! These simple tips will help you create websites that are accessible to everyone. Keep on coding!
